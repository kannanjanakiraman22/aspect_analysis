# Product Comparison using User Review Aspect Analysis 

This is the project for comparing two products using Aspects like Sound quality, Comfort for 2 headphone products like Sony MH720 and Soundcore Space One. The project uses Amazon Review comments as illustrative example. It identifies the hidden aspects using Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) and use it to identify Aspect level ratings and Aspect level Review comments. This will help the user in better decision making for the user to zoom in to aspects of interest. 

All the code is present in Jupyter notebook.
